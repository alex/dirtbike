Purpose of the software
-----------------------

This is a Python program that takes packages that are already installed
on a system and converst them to wheels.

That is an admittedly strange goal. The deeper purpose is to help
packages like `pip` vendor their dependencies in a way compatible with
the packaging policy for Debian, and hopefully other GNU/Linux
distributions.

Therefore, I am eager to see this tool discussed and/or adopted by
Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, and any other software distributions that
distribute pip as well as other Python packages.


Origin of the name
------------------

The name comes from a They Might Be Giants song::

  Here comes the dirt bike,
  Beware of the dirt bike.
  [...]
  You see I never thought I'd understand.
  Till that bike took me by the hand,
  Now I ride.

The real motivation behind the name was to find a word or two that
alludes to the idea of "wheel."
